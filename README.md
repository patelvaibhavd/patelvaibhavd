# Hi Folks, I'm Vaibhav Patel 👋🏻 💻

I'm Javascript developer (An entertaining personality 🤩 apart from being a developer. 🎧 Music is love 🥰 for me). 

Here is how I started my career, When I started my career at that point of time, I don't even knew what is frontend, backend and blah blah blah....And then I landed with my first job in programming. Yeahh 😌!! Experimenting with various technologies for sometime, I realized, I love to work with javascript and started with Angular (One of the finest framework of JS). Working with Angular JS to Angular 9, it became fun for me and now I am great at it 😬! (I have very good experience in Angular 😊)

Now, I feel like learning backend to get thorough idea of complete development of an application. As you know I love javascript 😉, what better than Node 😎, for backend. So, trying my hands on Node nowadays 👨‍💻, and it is fun too 🕺!!
